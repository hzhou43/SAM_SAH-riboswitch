# SAM_SAH-riboswitch
This repository contains MD simulation input and data, in directories MDsim and Source_data.

The files in MDsim are for simulations started with the MCTBI protocol, and include the simulaton
input file, the initial structure, and the final output of each simulation.

The excel file in Source_data contains data used to make plots in figures.
